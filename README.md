These are Java dn Python solutions for the following task.

## Task

The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as well as the target sum. ​ Sample output is shown below.

​ In the example, there is an executable named app. It takes as command line arguments a comma separated list of integers, and the target integer. Your app doesn't need to have identical input/output mechanisms. For example, you could read from a file instead of the command line. ​ You can assume that all input values are integers. You can assume that there aren't any repeat values in the list. ​ The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases should be handled appropriately. This is not a closed book test. You are encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across. ​
